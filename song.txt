I wish I found some better sounds
No one's ever heard
I wish I had a better voice
That sang some better words
I wish I found some chords
In an order that is new
I wish I didn't have to rhyme
Every time I sang
I was told when I get older
All my fears would shrink
But now I'm insecure
And I care what people think
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think
Wish we could turn back time
To the good old days
When our momma sang us to sleep
But now we're stressed out
Wish we could turn back time
To the good old days
When our momma sang us to sleep
But now we're stressed out
We're stressed out
Sometimes a certain smell will
Take me back to when I was young
How come I'm never able to identify
Where it's coming from?
I'd make a candle out of it
If I ever found it
Try to sell it, never sell out of it
I'd probably only sell one
It'd be to my brother, cause we have the same nose
Same clothes, home grown
The stone's throw from a creek we used to roam
But it would remind us of when
Nothing really mattered
Out of student loans and tree house homes
We all would take the latter
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think
Wish we could turn back time
To the good old days
When our momma sang us to sleep
But now we're stressed out
Wish we could turn back time
To the good old days
When our momma sang us to sleep
But now we're stressed out
Used to play pretend
Give each other different names
We would build a rocket ship and then we'd fly it far away
Used to dream of outer space
But now they're laughing at our face singing
"Wake up, you need to make money", yeah
Used to play pretend
Give each other different names
We would build a rocket ship
And then we'd fly it far away
Used to dream of outer space
But now they're laughing at our face singing
"Wake up, you need to make money", yeah
Wish we could turn back time
To the good old days
When our momma sang us to sleep
But now we're stressed out
Wish we could turn back time
To the good old days
When our momma sang us to sleep
But now we're stressed out
We used to play pretend, used to play pretend, money
We used to play pretend, wake up you need the money
Used to play pretend, used to play pretend, money
We used to play pretend, wake up you need the money
Used to play pretend
Give each other different names
We would build a rocket ship
And then we'd fly it far away
Used to dream of outer space
But now they're laughing at our face saying
"Wake up, you need to make money", yeah
